  <h1>John Conway’s Game of Life</h1>

  <h3>The Game</h3>

  <p>
    The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a cellular
    automaton, and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.
  </p>

  <p>
    This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article
    published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of
    cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or
    multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various
    patterns throughout the course of the game.
  </p>

  <h3>The Rules</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt>For a space that is populated:</dt>
    <dd>Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.</dd>
    <dd>
      Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
    </dd>
    <dd>Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.</dd>

    <dt>For a space that is empty or unpopulated</dt>
    <dd>Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>The Controls</h3>

  <p>
    Choose a figure from the pull-down menu or make one yourself by clicking
    on the cells with a mouse. A new generation of cells (corresponding to
    one iteration of the rules) is initiated by the 'Next' button. The
    'Start' button advances the game by several generations.
